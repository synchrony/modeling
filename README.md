# 3D modeling for Semantic Synchrony

This repository contains a Haskell library for specifying 3D models and mapping them into [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org),
along with a fork of the [Graphics.OpenSCAD](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/OpenSCAD) module by Mike Mayer.
If future tools are added here, they will also deal with 3D modeling and/or digital twins.

There is no independent package.yaml or stack.yaml at this time;
the repository is mean to be included in other projects as Git submodule.
